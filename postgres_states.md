# PostgreSQL Protocol States 

*By Nathaniel Bennett*


F is the frontend (i.e. the client)
B is the backend (i.e. the SQL server)
P is the proxy (i.e. SQLFortify)

B: <MsgType> -> F and F: <MsgType> -> B both indicate transparent proxying from client to server.

F: <MsgType> -> P indicates that the message should be intercepted by our proxy and MUST NOT be forwarded to the backend

P: <MsgType> -> F indicates that a message should be injected by our proxy into the message stream to the frontend

Side note: We might do well with injecting NegotiateProtocolVersion into any startup with a major version of 3 and minor version we don't yet support


Precedence of conditions (from first to last):
- The specific Message Type listed in the given state
- The specific Message Type listed in the 'ALL' state
- The wildcard Message Type listed in the given state
- The wildcard Message Type listed in the 'ALL' state

So, behaviors in ALL are overridden by behaviors in a given state, and wildcards are overridden by specific message behaviors.

### ALL (Default Behavior)

B: NoticeResponse -> F; nochange
B: ParameterStatus -> F; nochange
B: NotificationResponse -> F; nochange
B: * -> F; PermError

F: Terminate -> B; PermError
F: * -> B; PermError


### ClientStartup

F: StartupMessage -> B; StartupReceived
F: CancelRequest -> B; PermError
F: SSLRequest ONCE -> B; SSLReceived
F: GSSENCRequest ONCE -> B; GSSENCReceived

### StartupReceived

B: ErrorResponse -> F; PermError
B: AuthenticationOk -> F; ServerSetup

B: AuthenticationSASL -> F; AuthSASL
B: NegotiateProtocolVersion ONCE -> F; StartupReceived

### SSLReceived
B: SSLResponseS -> F; SSLEncrypt
B: SSLResponseN -> F; ClientStartup

### GSSENCReceived
B: GSSENCResponseG -> F; GSSEncrypt
B: GSSENCResponseN -> F; ClientStartup

### SSLEncrypt
F: <full_ssl_handshake> -> B; ClientStartup

### GSSEncrypt
F: <full_gssapi_handshake> -> B; ClientStartup

### AuthPassword

F: AuthDataResponse -> B; FinalAuthReceived

### AuthGSS

F: AuthDataResponse -> B; AuthGSSReceived

### AuthGSSReceived

B: ErrorResponse -> F; PermError
B: AuthenticationOk -> F; ServerSetup
B: AuthenticationGSSContinue -> F; AuthGSSContinued

### AuthGSSContinued

F: AuthDataResponse -> B; AuthGSSReceived

### AuthSASL

F: AuthDataResponse -> B; AuthSASLReceived

### AuthSASLReceived

B: ErrorResponse -> F; PermError
B: AuthenticationOk -> F; ServerSetup
B: AuthenticationSASLContinue -> F; AuthSASLContinued
B: AuthenticationSASLFinal -> F; FinalAuthReceived

### AuthSASLContinued

F: AuthDataResponse -> B; AuthSASLReceived

### FinalAuthReceived

B: ErrorResponse -> F; PermError
B: AuthenticationOk -> F; ServerSetup

### PermError

**Proxy closes both connections**

### InjectPermErrorClient

P: ErrorResponse -> F; PermError

### ServerSetup

B: ErrorResponse -> F; PermError
B: NegotiateProtocolVersion ONCE -> F; ServerSetup
B: BackendKeyData -> F; ServerSetup
B: ParameterStatus -> F; ServerSetup
B: NoticeResponse -> F; ServerSetup
B: ReadyForQuery -> F; ReadyForCommand

// When an error is detected while processing any extended-query message, the backend issues ErrorResponse, then reads and discards messages until a Sync is reached, then issues ReadyForQuery and returns to normal message processing. (But note that no skipping occurs if an error is detected while processing Sync â€” this ensures that there is one and only one ReadyForQuery sent for each Sync.)

From the PostgreSQL Documentation: When pipelining requests with extended queries, completion must be determined by counting ReadyForQuery messages and waiting for that to reach the number of Syncs sent.

This is a pretty surefire rule for
